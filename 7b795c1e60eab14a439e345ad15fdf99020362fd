      "message": "This is currently under core/device/event.  All public functions are exposed by the device.LogicalManager using struct embedding, and subsequently exposed by the NBIHandler using a second layer of struct embedding.\n\nI considered creating at a higher level, and passing it to both the device.LogicalManager \u0026 the NBIHandler, but this seemed like a cleaner solution, since it avoids having yet another manager at the top level.",
