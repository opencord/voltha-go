      "message": "We can also move to v12 of client-go. That would need us to also move api and apimachinery dependency to 1.15.x. \n\nBuild is fine after moving voltha-go dependency to v12 of k8s client-go and 1.15 of k8s api \u0026 apimachinery. Also, pods are coming up fine in kind-voltha setup.\n\nI see that you have initiated a query if we should move dependency of voltha-openolt-adapter and voltctl also to v12 of client-go; will wait for an answer on that before submitting an updated patch",
