      "message": "Since some params can be optional, it would be good to have some comments for this method.   For instance, if onuId is \"\" then parentPortNo is irrelevant.   A minor detail would be to have a variadic params (e,g, childOption ... int64) where a calling function can omit it completely or add all the needed params.   This can be done in a different update later on.",
