      "message": "nit:  the issue is not truly with the unit test, although this check is useful.   If length of Ids.Items is not 0 then the contents should not be nil.  This is an issue in the Core where several device creation and deletions (as this unit tests do) causes a race condition where a list of logical device returns a logical device that just got deleted.   It\u0027s not a serious issue but will need to be dealt with.",
