      "message": "My concern was that it was a public event and I wasn\u0027t sure exactly who if any one outside of voltha might be listening. Also I thought it might be a useful event if someone wanted to monitor when new devices are added to the system.\n\nAll that being said, happy to remove it. Thoughts?",

      "message": "Since it was only the affinity router listening to it then I think we should just removed it.  If it comes such a time that an external component needs to listen to device discovery then chances are that the content of the message will be quite different.   For affinity router it was limited information.  Code in the core/device/Manager.ChildDeviceDetected() will need to be modified to remove the discovery publish message.",
