      "message": "By removing some the device rules above, we may end up with a partial route (i.e. flow in parent device and none in child device (the opposite may also be true but very unlikely).  The logic for partial route deletion is different.  Should the partial route boolean be re-evaluated after the above changes?",

      "message": "The partial route logic assumes that the logical flow is decomposed into a flow for one parent device only or for a parent and a child device. As long as the OF controller (ONOS in this case) follows that logic then it is safe to set partial route when a device rule is removed.  If we get in the case where the parent device rule is removed but not the child device rule (race condition?) then I don\u0027t know if we would need a logic to remove flow from child device given that the child adapter would most likely not reach the device since the parent is gone.   @andrea can confirm whether the flows that the OF controller send are for 1 parent device only or for one parent and one child.",
