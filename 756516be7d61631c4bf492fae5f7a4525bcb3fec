      "message": "This is the only place where agent.deviceType is used.   The purpose of this use was to speed up packet processing without taking a peak into the device.   Since the device will be in the model\u0027s memory then a peak is not that expensive.   We would therefore only need a check in this method:\n\n\tif agent.deviceType \u003d\u003d \"\" {\n\t\tif d, err :\u003d agent.getDevice(); err !\u003d nil {\n\t\t\treturn err\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tagent.deviceType \u003d d.Type\n\t\t}\n\t}",
