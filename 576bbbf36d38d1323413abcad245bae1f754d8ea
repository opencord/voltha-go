As there is a single device agent in the rw-core per device and the requests need to be sent to the adapter through the agent, in any case we will need to make x number of calls to the adapters (one per ONU in the incoming request) and then the rw-core will have to wait on all these responses from the different ONU adapter instances and then return back from the RPC call. If the preference is to have this right now, we will implement it.",
