      "message": "Not sure if we want to hide the \"installs\". The issue is with this patch there are periods where you are not sure what is happening. i.e. `Style check OK` is output to console then there is a long pause as sanity is installed and loaded and you aren\u0027t sure what is happening. Seeing the commands output lets the caller know what is happening.",
