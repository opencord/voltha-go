      "message": "I\u0027m split on what the right behavior is:\na) keep the flow in the logical agent\nb) remove it from the logical agent, but do not remove it from the adapter\n\nIn case A ONOS will believe the flow was successfully installed, thus it won\u0027t push it again. This case will only work at scale if the failures are because of a timeout.\n\nIn case B ONOS will keep pushing the flow till it\u0027s reported via FlowStats. This will increase the traffic but will guarantee that flows that failed for some different reason are retried.\n\nI am leaning toward solution B (not implemented in this patch) but would like to get some opinions from others.",

      "message": "I think we need to clean the flow from rw-core and let the failed adapter to clean itself. So I\u0027m also leaning towards B. But an exception for this may be the flows that are decomposed to two different flows and sent to two different adapters. In this case when the flow is failed in an adapter, we may revert the flow of the other adapter.",
