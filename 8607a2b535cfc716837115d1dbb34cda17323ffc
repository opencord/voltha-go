      "message": "Jenkins is failing because it tried to run \u0027dep ensure\u0027 and Gopkg.lock for voltha-go cannot reference voltha-go.  Also Gopkg.toml has not changed to add voltha-go, yet it is somehow in this file.  \n\nSo im not sure how this file could end up in this state.  Last time this happened with this patch set I had to manually remove entries from Gopkg.lock and run \u0027dep ensure\u0027 to fix it.",
