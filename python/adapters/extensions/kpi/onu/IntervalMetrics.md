# ONU OMCI Historical Interval PM Groups

This document outlines the 15-minute interval groups currently supported by the
**OnuPmIntervalMetrics** _onu_pm_interval_metrics.py_ file.  These groups
cover a 15-minute interval.

## Performance Interval State Machine

At OpenOMCI startup within an ONU Device Adapter, as soon as the OpenOMCI ME database has
been declared to be in-sync ONU's ME Database, the Performance Interval State Machine is
started for the ONU. The first task it performs is to synchronize the ONU's (hardware) time with
the ONU Device Handler's (Linux container) so that a 15-minute interval is established.

The OpenOMCI PM interval state machine then examines managed elements created by the
ONU autonomously or created by OpenOMCI in response to a OMCI request from an ONU
adapter to determine if an appropriate 15-Minute historical PM ME needs to be attached. The
state machine also registers for notification of any create/delete requests at that
point so that it can add/remove 15-minute historical PM MEs as services are applied or
removed. 

Before adding a 15-minute historical PM ME, the ME capabilities of the ONU is
examined to insure that it can support that particular ME. This is important as the
Ethernet Frame historical intervals are actually supported by up to 4 different MEs
reporting the basically the same data. This is detailed below in the _Ethernet Frame
Performance Monitoring MEs_ section.

## Timezone

The ONU will be synchronized to the Linux Container running the ONU Device handler's
time in UTC upon startup. Not all ONUs have the capability to set their calendar 
date (month, day, year) to that of the ONU's Device Handler, but it will set the
clock to that date. For reporting of 15-minute intervals, only an accurate 15-minute
boundary is really of any great importance.

## Interval Reporting

After the ONU time synchronization request is made, the first reported interval is
schedule to occur in the next 15-minute boundry.  For example, if the OpenOMCI
state machine synchronizes the ONU's time at 

## Common Elements for All Reported MEs

In addition to counter elements (attributes) reported in each ME, every reported 
historical interval report the following Elements as context values in the KPI
Event metadata field.  Each value is reported as a _string_ per the Protobuf structure 
but are actually integer/floats.

| Label               | Type         | Description |
| ------------------: | :----------: | :---------- |
| class_id            | int, 16-bits | The ME Class ID of the PM Interval ME |
| entity_id           | int, 16-bits | The OMCI Entity Instance of the particular PM Interval ME |
| interval_end_time   | int, 8-bits  | Identifies the most recently finished 15 minute. This attribute is set to zero when a synchronize time request is performed by OpenOMCI.  This counter rolls over from 255 to 0 upon saturation. | 
| interval_start_time | int, 64-bits | The UTC timestamp (seconds since epoch) rounded down to the start time of the specific interval |

# Supported 15-Minute Historical Performance Monitoring MEs

The following 15-minute historical performance monitoring MEs currently supported are detailed
in the sections below

## Ethernet Frame Performance Monitoring MEs

The OMCI Ethernet PM supported by OpenOMCI includes 4 possible MEs.  These MEs are attached to
the MAC Bridge Port Configuration MEs for the ONU. For downstream data, the ME is placed on the
MAC Bridge Port Configuration ME closest to the ANI Port. For upstream data, the ME is placed
on the MAC Bridge Port Configuration ME closest to the associated UNI.

The OpenOMCI will first attempt to use the Extended Performance Monitoring MEs if they are
supported by the ONU.  First the 64-bit counter version will be attempted and then the 32-bit
counters as a fallback. If of the Extended Performance Monitoring MEs are supported, the
appropriate Upstream or DownStream Monitoring ME will be used.

counter width (in bytes) and ME Class ID.

## GEM Port Network CTP Monitoring History Data (Class ID 341)

This managed entity collects GEM frame performance monitoring data associated with a GEM port
network CTP. Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.

Note 1: One might expect to find some form of impaired or discarded frame count associated with
a GEM port. However, the only impairment that might be detected at the GEM frame level would be
a corrupted GEM frame header. In this case, no part of the header could be considered reliable
including the port ID. For this reason, there is no impaired or discarded frame count in this ME.

Note 2: This managed entity replaces the GEM port performance history data managed entity and
is preferred for new implementations.

| transmitted_gem_frames    | 32-bits | This attribute counts GEM frames transmitted on the monitored GEM port. |
| received_gem_frames       | 32-bits | This attribute counts GEM frames received correctly on the monitored GEM port. A correctly received GEM frame is one that does not contain uncorrectable errors and has a valid HEC. |

| transmitted_payload_bytes | 64-bits | This attribute counts user payload bytes transmitted on the monitored GEM port. |

If the GEM port is encrypted, this attribute counts any frame whose key index specifies a key that is not known to the ONU. |
