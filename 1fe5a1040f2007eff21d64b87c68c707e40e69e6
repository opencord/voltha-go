Do we want to allow addition of logical ports on a disabled device?\n\nRemoving the operational status check and creating the logical ports would imply that some flows (default from ONOS?) relevant to that UNI will be sent down.   Would that be ok?  If those flows are only on the parent device then that should be ok.\n\nIf the child device is not fully operational then would the call below (getPortCapability) succeed?",
