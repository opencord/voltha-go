      "message": "There is a small subtlety between returning an invalid transition and a nil handler.   A invalid transition implies that it\u0027s possible to see such a transition (on all kind of failures from adapters) and we need to mark them as invalid and flag them (eventually sending an event on kafka).  A nil handler is a no-op transition (i.e. if a transition is not in this state machine then it is a nil handler, i.e. no-op).   Therefore, we still need to have the invalid transition here.",
