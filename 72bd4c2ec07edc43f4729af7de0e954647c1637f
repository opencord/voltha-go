      "message": "Trying to understand the concept and the behaviour we are trying to create. My understanding is that if the liveness/readiness probes fail then K8s will restart the service. \n\nNow if the grpc connection between the ofagent and the vcore is lost, do we want k8s to restart ofagent? Will that help?",

Can we split the 4 check conditions into two sets. \nConnectionManager.channel and ConnectionManager.is_alive for Liveness Probe (If it fails the pod will be restarted)\nConnectionManager.subscription and ConnectionManager.grpc_client for Readiness Probe (If it fails the pod will be isolated from traffic)",

It gets set to True once and never again becomes False. The Liveness should be able to catch situations where a restart of the container is required.",
