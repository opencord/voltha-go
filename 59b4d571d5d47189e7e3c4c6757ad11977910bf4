(this interaction contains, or should contain, all the complex mutex locking)\n\n\"_loader\" to me implies that it handles lower-level interaction \u0026 ultimately talks to the kv.\n\nI\u0027m open to naming suggestions.  \n\nWas considering \"_manager\", but thought it applied more to high-level flow management.\n\nThe logical separation isn\u0027t perfect, since no functions have been changed.",
