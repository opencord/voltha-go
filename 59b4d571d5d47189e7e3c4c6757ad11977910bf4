(this interaction contains, or should contain, all the complex mutex locking)\n\n\"_loader\" to me implies that it handles lower-level interaction \u0026 ultimately talks to the kv.\n\nI\u0027m open to naming suggestions.  \n\nWas considering \"_manager\", but thought it applied more to high-level flow management.\n\nThe logical separation isn\u0027t perfect, since no functions have been changed.",

      "message": "Agreed, but the tight coupling of device \u0026 logical_device doesn\u0027t allow this.\n\nInstead, I would like to try to modify the functionality in each of the logical_agent_xxx files to be self-contained, and then move each out into separate packages.  Feasibility still tbd.\n\nThis is similar to what I did when pulling other components out of the core package: determine where it makes sense to divide things, and pull each functionality out into its own package.",
