But I can see there is no real fitting state in the device definitions - perhaps still \u0027unknown\u0027. Maybe something better is still missing here, something like \u0027IMAGE_ACTIVATION_FAILED\u0027 (similar to download) or later maybe different states for \u0027IMAGE_ONU_DOWNLOAD_FAILED\u0027 and \u0027IMAGE_ONU_ACTIVATION_FAILED\u0027.",
