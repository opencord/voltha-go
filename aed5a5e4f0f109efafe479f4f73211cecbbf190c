If the function signature changes in a backward-compatible manner, then I would expect the unit test to continue to pass. If the signature changes in a manner that is not backward-compatible then I would expect the unit test to break either due to a compile-time issue or due to incorrect behavior. Willing to be convinced otherwise, I just have not seen this type of testing before.",
