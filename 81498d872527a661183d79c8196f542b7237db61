      "message": "The deletion of flows have so far been handled by the state transition machine.  Granted, it is missing in many delete-like transitions.   Would it make sense to invoke the deletion of logical flows and meters from here as well?  I am thinking of cases (if any) where we may want to delete the flows and meters but not the logical device.",
