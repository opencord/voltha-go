      "message": "Logical device should be invoking the device mgr to get the device in case there is concurrent access/change to the device.   You need to be careful here as the lock may already have been obtained, hence causing a deadlock.  It is preferable not to invoke a getdevice at all here and use the data passed in params.   If the root device is absolutely required then it is better to pass it as a param.",
