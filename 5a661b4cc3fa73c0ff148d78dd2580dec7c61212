If the device is a child device and the parent device cannot be found then a codes.Unavailbale is returned.  This can be confusing.   In this case since you are using NotFound to indicate the absence of a device then it\u0027s better to return NotFound in all cases where a device is not found.  Sorry, did not notice this before.",
