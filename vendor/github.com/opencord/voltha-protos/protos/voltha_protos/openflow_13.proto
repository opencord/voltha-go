/* OpenFlow: protocol between controller and datapath. */

/*
 * This is a relatively straightforward rendering of OpenFlow message
 * definitions into protocol buffer messages. We preserved the snake
 * case syntax, and made the following changes:
 * - all pad fields dropped
 * - for each enum value above 0x7fffffff the MSB is dropped. For example,
 *   0xffffffff is now 0x7fffffff.
 * - '<type> thing[...]' is replaced with 'repeated <type> thing'
 * - 'char thing[...]' is replaced with 'string thing'
 * - 'uint8_t data[...]' is replaced with 'bytes data'
 * - the following systematic changes are done to various integer types:
 *   uint8_t  -> uint32
 *   uint16_t -> uint32
 *   uint32_t -> uint32
 *   uint64_t -> uint64
 * - removed most length, len, size fields where these values can be determined
 *   from the explicitly encoded length of "repeated" protobuf fields.
 * - explicit use of enum types whereever it is unambigous (and not used as
 *   bitmask/flags value.
 *
